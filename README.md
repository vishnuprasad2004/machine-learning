# Machine Learning
Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Supervised learning and unsupervised learning are two main types of machine learning.

## Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that learns from labeled data. Labeled data has been tagged with a correct answer or classification.
Supervised learning, as the name indicates, has the presence of a supervisor as a teacher. Supervised learning is when we teach or train the machine using data that is well-labelled. Which means some data is already tagged with the correct answer.
After that, the machine is provided with a new set of examples(data) so that the supervised learning algorithm analyses the training data(set of training examples) and produces a correct outcome from labeled data.

### Examples:
Let’s say you have a fruit basket that you want to identify. The machine would first analyze the image to extract features such as its shape, color, and texture. 
Then, it would compare these features to the features of the fruits it has already learned about. If the new image’s features are most similar to those of an apple, the machine would predict that the fruit is an 
apple. For instance, suppose you are given a basket filled with different kinds of fruits. Now the first step is to train the machine with all the different fruits one by one like this: 
* If the shape of the object is rounded and has a depression at the top, is red in color, then it will be labeled as  &RightArrow; Apple.
* If the shape of the object is a long curving cylinder having a Green-Yellow color, then it will be labeled as &RightArrow; Banana. 

### Applications:
* Email &RightArrow; can be spam or not spam ... which can be used in Spam Filtering
* Audio &RightArrow; transcripts ... is used in Speech Recognition

### There are 2 types of Supervised Learning Algorithms:
1. Regression - prediction of target value based on feature value(s)
2. Classification - categorizing the output variable based on its corresponding features
